C Lab 0.

Your lab instructor will  help you log into cis-linux2 using Putty, and give a
short introduction to unix commands. Then they will show you 
how to use pico to enter the file from class (repeated below) into a file named
add.c

Next, give the command 
gcc -o add add.c 
to compile (translate) your program.  Then run your program by
typing

./add

Once it is working properly, try making some 
intentional mistakes.  Leave off a ",  use too many or too few )'s, and so on.
Make note of the error responses you get to these syntax errors.

Your instructor will tell you how to submit your working program, which will
be due at the beginning of your second lab period.

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void main(void)
{
  int num1, num2;
  int sum;

  printf("Enter an integer:");
  scanf ("%lf", &num1);
  printf("Enter another integer:");
  scanf ("%lf", &num2);

  sum = num1 + num2;
  printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d", num1, num2, sum);
}
